Utilizing the advanced features of C, such as socket programming and multithreading, this Cyber Management System application has been built.
The system is divided into two modules: client module and server module.The server program is for managing settings and client requests. The client program 
gives clients access to the cyber services. Both these source codes are short, each around 100 lines.
